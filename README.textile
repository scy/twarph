h2. Why Are You Releasing It?

According to the motto "release early, release often".

Also I needed some kind of project page.

h2. What License Is It Released Under?

Since this project is right now less than a week old, I'm not sure yet, but it will be a true open-source license.
Right now you can view the code and you may use and modify it for personal use, but not distribute it.
But I do accept patches.
